 * The equirectangular render-to-texture pass.
 *
 * For each pixel of a 2:1 output framebuffer this takes the direction
 * that pixel represents, ray-marches it from a configurable camera
 * position against the unit sphere, and samples the sphere's texture
 * at the hit point. One pass, native 2:1 output, no pole artifacts —
 * see `docs/MULTI_MONITOR_PLAN.md` §"Equirectangular RTT is one shader
 * pass, not a cubemap", which rejects the cubemap-and-convert route
 * outright. Do not build the cubemap path.
 *
 * With the camera at the sphere's centre the mapping is the identity
 * and the output is a uniform equirectangular unwrap. Moving the
 * camera off-centre makes it non-uniform: surface points on the side
 * the camera moved toward subtend larger angles and take up more of
 * the frame, so the area of focus grows on the physical sphere while
 * the antipode compresses. That warp *is* the zoom, it is the primary
 * v1 mode rather than a forward-compat hook, and it is what SOS
 * installations have done for over a decade (§3.5).
 *
 * **Everything here except the GLSL strings is pure**, mirroring the
 * shader in TypeScript so the projection — the part most likely to be
 * wrong and least likely to *look* wrong on a sphere nobody in this
 * repo can see — is unit-testable without a GL context. Same split as
 * `src/services/datasetProbe.ts`.
 *
 * Deliberately no Three.js import. This module is the maths and the
 * shader source; commit 3 builds the material and the render target
 * around it, and the repo lazy-loads Three everywhere so a static
 * import here would pull it into any bundle that touches the
 * projection.
 *
 * Not here yet, on purpose:
 *
 * - **Layer compositing.** This samples one sphere texture. The
 *   multi-shell stack arrives with `layerStack.ts` in commit 4.
